title: Security and Permission Types
---

Each endpoint in the 3Commas API has specific security and permission types, which determine how you can interact with it.

## Security Types

Security types define the authentication required to access API endpoints.

| Security Type | Description |
|---------------|--------------|
| NONE | Endpoint can be accessed freely |
| SIGNED | Requires a valid `APIKey` and a `Signature` for access |


## Permission Types

    Each API endpoint has a specific permission type that defines how it can be accessed. Also the 3Commas API allows configuring API Keys with different permission sets.<br/>
    For example, one API Key might provide access to read-only statistics, while another could enable full control over bots and accounts.
