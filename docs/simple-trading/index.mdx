# Simple Trading

The Simple Trading API allows users to create, manage, and close orders on supported exchanges based on predefined conditions.

This is a low-level Order Management System (OMS) API that functions as a "unified exchange terminal" across all supported exchanges.

The 3Commas Order Management System (OMS) accepts commands to create and manage orders in a standardized format, handling all exchange-specific intricacies so users don’t have to.

Additionally, it offers several quality-of-life features:

* Support for all 3Commas order types — such as Absolute Trailing, Relative Trailing, Conditional Trailing, Conditional Market, Conditional Limit, and others — even if the exchange itself doesn’t support them. Their behavior is emulated by 3Commas.
* Automatic recreation of orders if they are canceled by the exchange or a third party.
* Automatic adjustment of order size if it slightly exceeds available funds — the system reduces the size to fit the balance.
* Automatic handling of lot size and precision, so users don’t need to worry about formatting or rounding.

In 3Commas terminology:
* A **Trade** is the core entity of the OMS.
* A **Trade** may consist of one or more **Exchange Orders**.
