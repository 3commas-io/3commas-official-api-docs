The Deal is a sub-entity of the DCA Bot. It represents a single automated transaction executed based on the bot's configured strategy.

The Deal entity holds the following information about:

* Order type
* Trading pair(s)
* Status of the deal
* Initial and realized trade amounts
* Initial and realized total values of the trade
* Price details, including entry, average, and final prices
* Position percentage reached during the trade
* Conditions related to trailing mechanisms and triggers (e.g., trailing stop enabled, trigger price)

Deals are created automatically by the DCA Bot based on predefined conditions and the selected trading strategy.

A Deal can include various trading stages or types, depending on the configuration, such as:

* Initial trade opening
* Trailing Take Profit execution
* Stop Loss activation
* Safety orders placement
* Final trade closure

Here, you can find methods and attributes to monitor, update, or analyze the details of deal.
