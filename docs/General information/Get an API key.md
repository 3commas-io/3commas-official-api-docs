We offer two ways to generate API Key:

<details>
<summary>1. 3Commas system generated</summary>
<p>
Works in a symmetric encryption method. A Secret Key will be provided to you. Please keep this Key secure and treat it like your password. Do not share the Key with any third parties.
</p>

<details>
<summary>2. Self generated</summary>
<p>
