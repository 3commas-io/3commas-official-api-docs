### Ways to generate API Key

We offer two ways to generate API Key:

<details>
<summary>1. 3Commas system generated</summary>

Works in a symmetric encryption method. A Secret Key will be provided to you. Please keep this Key secure and treat it like your password. Do not share the Key with any third parties.

</details>
<details>
<summary>2. Self generated</summary>

Works in a RSA asymmetric encryption method. You will have to create your ow Public and Private Keys via software. Then you will only have to provide the Public Key.

</details>

We recommend a second way because it's most secure method to connect your apps.
