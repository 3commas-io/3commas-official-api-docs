## Ways to generate API Key

We offer two ways to generate API Key:

1. **3Commas system generated:** Works in a symmetric encryption method. A Secret Key will be provided to you. Please keep this Key secure and treat it like your password. Do not share the Key with any third parties.

2. **Self generated:** Works in a RSA asymmetric encryption method. You will have to create your ow Public and Private Keys via software. Then you will only have to provide the Public Key.

We recommend a second way because it's most secure method to connect your apps.


## How to get an API Key

To create and manage an API Key, [sign in](https://app.3commas.io/en/auth/login) to 3Commas and select 3Commas API from the right-side menu.

On the page, click the **<span style={{ color: "green" }}>New API access token</span>** button and select the method for generating the API Key. Then, complete the form fields. If you select Self-generated, you need to provide an RSA Private Key.
