## General Rules

Our REST API enforces a maximum of **100 requests per minute**.

If the rate limit is exceeded, the API will respond with an HTTP status code `429 Too Many Requests`, and access will be temporarily restricted for a mitigation period of 300 seconds.

## Rate limits for specific endpoints


<Endpoint
  url="/ver1/deals"
  method="GET"
/>

120 requests per minute. If the rate limit is exceeded, the API will respond with an HTTP status code `429 Too Many Requests`, and access will be temporarily restricted for a mitigation period of 60 seconds.

<Separator type="additionalInformation" />

<Endpoint
  url="/ver1/smart_trades"
  method="GET"
/>

40 requests per 10 seconds. If the rate limit is exceeded, the API will respond with an HTTP status code `429 Too Many Requests`, and access will be temporarily restricted for a mitigation period of 10 seconds.

<Separator type="additionalInformation" />

<Endpoint
  url="/ver1/deals/:deal_id/show"
  method="GET"
/>

120 requests per minute. If the rate limit is exceeded, the API will respond with an HTTP status code `429 Too Many Requests`, and access will be temporarily restricted for a mitigation period of 60 seconds.

<Separator type="additionalInformation" />

After receiving a `429 Too Many Requests` status code, you must reduce the frequency of your requests. Repeated violations or failure to slow down after a `429` response may result in an automatic IP ban (HTTP status `418`).

IP bans are tracked and increase in duration for repeated violations, ranging from 2 minutes to 3 days.
