# Grid Bots

Grid Bot entities are designed to automate trading strategies by executing a series of buy and sell orders within predefined price ranges. They allow users to take advantage of market fluctuations while minimizing manual intervention.

Grid Bot entities hold information such as:
    
  * Configuration details for the bot, including the trading pair, strategy type, and grid settings;
  * Performance metrics like current profit, total profits, and investment amounts in base and quote currencies;
 * Status indicators, such as whether the bot is enabled or disabled and whether stop-loss actions are set.

 3Commas offers a range of tools to create new Grid Bots, manage their settings, and analyze their performance effectively.
