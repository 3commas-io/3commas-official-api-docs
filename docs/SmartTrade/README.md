<p style={{ margin: '0 0 20px 0' }} >
  3Commas provides a set of methods to create and manage SmartTrade entities and their associated trade entities.
</p>
<p style={{ margin: '0 0 10px 0' }} >
  A SmartTrade entity holds information, including:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> Exchange account and trading pair;</li>
  <li> Position data;</li>
  <li> Conditions for Take Profit and Stop Loss;</li>
  <li> Conditions for closing at market</li>
  <li> Conditions for reducing funds</li>
</ul>
<p>
The process starts with a SmartTrade entity, where all conditions are configured.
</p>
<p style={{ margin: '0 0 20px 0' }} >
SmartTrade then manages trades, which are automatically created by 3Commas based on the conditions set within the SmartTrade entity.
</p>
<p style={{ margin: '0 0 10px 0' }} >

</p>
<ul>
  <li> Position trade;</li>
  <li> Take profit trade; </li>
