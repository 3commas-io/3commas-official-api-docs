# SmartTrade

<StickyLayout.Root>
<StickyLayout.Main>

The SmartTrade allows users to open, manage, and close orders on the exchange with predefined conditions.

3Commas provides a set of methods to create and manage SmartTrade entities and their associated trade entities.

A SmartTrade entity holds information, including:

  * Exchange account and trading pair
  * Position data
  * Conditions for Take Profit and Stop Loss
  * Conditions for closing at market
  * Conditions for reducing funds

The process starts with a SmartTrade entity, where all conditions are configured.

SmartTrade then manages trades, which are automatically created by 3Commas based on the conditions set within the SmartTrade entity.

SmartTrade can include the following trade types:

 * Position trade
 * Take profit trade
 * Stop-loss trade
 * Reduce funds trade
 * Market close trade
