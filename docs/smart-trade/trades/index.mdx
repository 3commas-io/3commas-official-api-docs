The Trade is a sub-entity of SmartTrade. Each trade entity includes the conditions set for its specific trade type.

The Trade entity holds the following information about:

* Order type
* Trading pair
* Trade status
* Initial and realized amounts
* Initial and realized total values
* Price values, including initial, average, and realized prices
* Position percentage for the trade
* Conditions related to trailing and triggers (e.g. trailing enabled, trigger price)

Each trade is created automatically by 3Commas based on the conditions set within the SmartTrade entity.

Depending on the conditions set within SmartTrade, a trade can be one of the following types:

- Position trade
- Take profit trade
- Stop-loss trade
- Reduce funds trade
- Market close trade

Here you will find a set of methods to manage these trades.
