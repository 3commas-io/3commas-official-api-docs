# Public Rest API for 3commas.io (2024-07-08)
# General API Information
* Official Announcements regarding changes, downtime, etc. to the API will be reported here: **https://t.me/commas_API**
* We have telegram group where you can discuss any issues with API **https://t.me/xcommas_api**
* Streams, endpoints, parameters, payloads, etc. decscribed in the documents in this repository are considered **official** and **supported**.
* The use of any other streams, endpoints, parameters, or payloads, etc. is **not supported**; **use them at your own risk and with no guarantees.**
* The base endpoint is: **https://api.3commas.io/public/api**
* All endpoints return either a JSON object or array.
* PAIR format is **QUOTE_BASE** (for example USDT_BTC) for all exchanges (no matter what format the exchange is using).
* Data is returned in **ascending** order. Oldest first, newest last.
* All time and timestamp related fields are in seconds.
* HTTP `4XX` return codes are used for malformed requests; the issue is on the sender's side.
* HTTP `429` return code is used when breaking a request rate limit.
* HTTP `418` return code is used when an IP has been auto-banned for continuing to send requests after receiving `429` codes.
* HTTP `5XX` return codes are used for internal errors; the issue is on 3commas's side.
* HTTP `504` return code is used when the API successfully sent the message

* Any endpoint can return an ERROR; the error payload is as follows:
```javascript
{
  "error": "record_invalid",
  "error_description": "Invalid parameters",
  "error_attributes": {
    "api_key": [
      "is too short (minimum is 5 characters)"
    ],
    "secret": [
      "is too short (minimum is 5 characters)"
    ],
    "name": [
      "is too short (minimum is 2 characters)"
    ]
  }
}
```
* error field is mandatory. Specific error codes and messages defined in another document.
* error_description is localized extended description of error occurred. Optional.
* error_attributes used to show fields that didn't pass validations. Optional.
* For `GET` endpoints, parameters must be sent as a `query string`.
* For `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` endpoints, the parameters may be sent as a
  `query string` or in the `request body` with content type
  `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` or `application/json`. You may mix parameters between both the
  `query string` and `request body` if you wish to do so.
* Parameters may be sent in any order.
* If a parameter sent in both the `query string` and `request body`, the
  `query string` parameter will be used.

* https://github.com/bogdanteodoru/py3cw (Python 3.x implementation)

# LIMITS
* A 429 will be returned when either rather limit is violated.
* Each route has a `weight` which determines for the number of requests each endpoint counts for. Heavier endpoints and endpoints that do operations on multiple symbols will have a heavier `weight`.
* When a 429 is received, it's your obligation as an API to back off and not spam the API.
* **Repeatedly violating rate limits and/or failing to back off after receiving 429s will result in an automated IP ban (HTTP status 418).**
* IP bans are tracked and **scale in duration** for repeat offenders, **from 2 minutes to 3 days**.

# Endpoint security type
* Each endpoint has a security type that determines the how you will interact with it.
* API-keys are passed into the Rest API via the `Apikey` header.
* API-keys and secret-keys **are case sensitive**.
* API-keys can be configured to only access certain types of secure endpoints.
 For example, one API-key could be used for STATS only, while another API-key can access everything.


Security Type | Description
------------ | ------------
NONE | Endpoint can be accessed freely.
SIGNED | Endpoint requires sending a valid API-Key and signature.
 
 
 
# SIGNED  Endpoint security
* `SIGNED` endpoints require an additional header, `Signature`, to be sent.
* Endpoints use `HMAC SHA256` signatures. The `HMAC SHA256 signature` is a keyed `HMAC SHA256` operation.
  Use your `secretKey` as the key and `uri?totalParams` as the value for the HMAC operation.
* The `signature` is **not case sensitive**.
* `totalParams` is defined as the `query string` concatenated with the `request body`.

## SIGNED Endpoint Examples for POST /public/api/ver1/users/change_mode
Here is a step-by-step example of how to send a valid signed payload from the
Linux command line using `echo`, `openssl`, and `curl`.

Key | Value
------------ | ------------
api_key | vmPUZE6mv9SD5VNHk4HlWFsOr6aKE2zvsw0MuIgwCIPy6utIco14y7Ju91duEh8A
secret | NhqPtmdSJYdKjVHjA7PZj4Mge3R5YNiP1e3UZjInClVN65XAbvqqM6A7H5fATj0j


Parameter | Value
------------ | ------------
mode | paper


### Example 1: As a query string
* **queryString:** mode=paper
* **HMAC SHA256 signature:**

    ```
    [linux]$ echo -n "/public/api/ver1/users/change_mode?mode=paper" | openssl dgst -sha256 -hmac "NhqPtmdSJYdKjVHjA7PZj4Mge3R5YNiP1e3UZjInClVN65XAbvqqM6A7H5fATj0j"
    (stdin)= bca8d8c10acfbe8e76c5335d3efbe0a550487170a8bb7aaea0a13efabab55316
    ```


* **curl command:**

    ```
    (HMAC SHA256)
    [linux]$ curl -H "Apikey: vmPUZE6mv9SD5VNHk4HlWFsOr6aKE2zvsw0MuIgwCIPy6utIco14y7Ju91duEh8A" -H "Signature: bca8d8c10acfbe8e76c5335d3efbe0a550487170a8bb7aaea0a13efabab55316" -X POST 'https://api.3commas.io/public/api/ver1/users/change_mode?mode=paper'
    ```

### Example 2: As a request body
* **requestBody:** mode=paper
* **HMAC SHA256 signature:**

    ```
    [linux]$ echo -n "/public/api/ver1/users/change_mode?mode=paper" | openssl dgst -sha256 -hmac "NhqPtmdSJYdKjVHjA7PZj4Mge3R5YNiP1e3UZjInClVN65XAbvqqM6A7H5fATj0j"
    (stdin)= bca8d8c10acfbe8e76c5335d3efbe0a550487170a8bb7aaea0a13efabab55316
    ```


* **curl command:**

    ```
    (HMAC SHA256)
    [linux]$ curl -H "Apikey: vmPUZE6mv9SD5VNHk4HlWFsOr6aKE2zvsw0MuIgwCIPy6utIco14y7Ju91duEh8A" -H "Signature: bca8d8c10acfbe8e76c5335d3efbe0a550487170a8bb7aaea0a13efabab55316" -X POST 'https://api.3commas.io/public/api/ver1/users/change_mode' -d 'mode=paper' 
    ```
  
### Example 3: As a raw json
* **requestBody:** '{"mode": "paper"}'
* **HMAC SHA256 signature:**
    
    ```
    [linux]$ echo -n "/public/api/ver1/users/change_mode?{\"mode\": \"paper\"}" | openssl dgst -sha256 -hmac "NhqPtmdSJYdKjVHjA7PZj4Mge3R5YNiP1e3UZjInClVN65XAbvqqM6A7H5fATj0j"
    (stdin)= 0475b407ba6f2388d213134e478b330f74073388a232737837f79018694ae373
    ```
* **curl command:**

    ```
    (HMAC SHA256)
    [linux]$ curl -H "Apikey: vmPUZE6mv9SD5VNHk4HlWFsOr6aKE2zvsw0MuIgwCIPy6utIco14y7Ju91duEh8A" -H "Signature: 0475b407ba6f2388d213134e478b330f74073388a232737837f79018694ae373" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST 'https://api.3commas.io/public/api/ver1/users/change_mode' --data-raw '{"mode": "paper"}' 
    ```

## SIGNED Endpoint Examples for GET /public/api/ver1/bots/{bot_id}/show
Here is a step-by-step example of how to test your endpoint through postman.

Once Postman works with the values, you can implement it in code.

### Step 1: Set up GET url:
* **With include_events:** https://api.3commas.io/public/api/ver1/bots/EnterBotIdHere/show?include_events=true

By using include_events in the query string, in Postman, your Params field will be automatically filled in

### Step 2: Calculate your Signature:
Use a HMAC SHA256 generator tool.

"" | ""
------------ | ------------
Input value | /public/api/ver1/bots/84512/show?include_events=true
Secret Key | Use your secret API key from 3commas
Hashed Output | Signature result to be used in Step 3


### Step 3: Set up Headers:
Key | Value
------------ | ------------
Apikey | 3commas API key goes here
Signature | Calculated Signature from Step 2 goes here

These 2 key/value pairs can be entered in Postman under Headers (which is located under the GET url field)

### Step 4: Receive JSON object:
If you have followed these steps you should now receive a status 200 OK with your JSON data.

# SIGNED  Endpoint security (RSA)
Look [here](signed_endpoints_rsa.md) for more information about RSA key pair and how to compute signature for signed API requests. 

# API modes(real or paper)

By default, API mode(real or paper) synchronized with mode in web/app.

You can set a forced mode for public API through the request header "Forced-Mode" with values "real" or "paper".

# Supported Leverage Types
> Previously API supported `custom` value for `leverage_type`. 
> Now it is **DEPRECATED** and needs to be changed to `isolated`. 
> If you pass `custom` value as `leverage[type]` 3commas saves it as `isolated` **anyway**.
> 
> Supported leverage types depend on the market you use:

Market | Supported Leverage Types
-----|-----
FTX Futures | cross
Bybit | isolated, cross
Binance Futures COIN-M | isolated, cross
Bitmex | isolated, cross
Binance Futures | isolated, cross
